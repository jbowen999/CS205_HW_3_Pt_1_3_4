Pros and Cons of Static and Instance Methods

Static Methods:

    Pros:
        Concise: No need for an instance, good for utility functions.
        Shared Logic: Ideal for operations not tied to object state.
    Cons:
        No Instance Access: Can't access or modify object-specific data.
        Less Flexibility: Limited to stateless operations.

Instance Methods:

    Pros:
        Object-Oriented: Natural for encapsulating behavior with data.
        Access to Instance State: Can manipulate object-specific data.
    Cons:
        Requires an Instance: More verbose, needs an object to call.
        Potential for Boilerplate: More setup required.

Natural Expression of Computation

    Static Methods: Best for universal, stateless operations.
    Instance Methods: Suitable for computations involving object state and behavior.

Conclusion: Use static methods for global, utility functions and instance methods for stateful, object-specific logic.
